        "Description": "Actor Taapsee Pannu wonders why only cotton dresses find a mention in conversation around comfortable fashion, and not saree. She hopes to change it.Actor Taapsee Pannu has been turning heads in Paris with her stylish fashion choices. She's been rocking vibrant sarees on the streets, making a statement and showing off her love for traditional Indian attire. The actor believes that sarees shouldn't be limited to special events; instead, they should be celebrated and worn every day. Also read: Taapsee Pannu's refreshing saree looks to support husband Mathias Boe at Paris Olympics should inspire you. Pics The actor has turned her Instagram account into her personal diary to capture all her sartorial choices as she is in Paris to support her husband and Indian badminton coach Mathias Boe at the Olympic Games. And she is overwhelmed with all the love coming her way. In fact, taking a step forward, Taapsee recently collaborated with the brand, Suta, to launch a saree collection, which is named #TAPCollection. \"Regarding the Suta Association I think I discovered a new side of my personality. When I embraced wearing sarees and by sarees, I don\u2019t mean the ones that people generally wear on a red carpets or special occasions or festivals, I\u2019m talking about the daily wear sarees,\u201d Taapsee said. The actor added, \u201cI realised how a different side of my personality started showing when I wore those sarees and with time when I started liking what I saw in the mirror I slowly started getting more and more comfortable wearing those sarees\u201d. A post shared by Taapsee Pannu (@taapsee) She wonders why only cotton dresses find a mention in conversation around comfortable fashion, and not saree. \u201cWhen it is actually very comfortable, you should just know how to drape it and just be confident about it and extremely comfortable. It\u2019s not even size specific. It\u2019s not like you buy one dress which is a particular size and you have to make sure you fit in it,\u201d Taapsee mentions. Giving words to her views, the actor shared, \u201cSaree is a piece of cloth that can adjust to your size. No matter what size you are. It can suit any occasion. I don't really believe the fact that saree can be only worn for festivals, or red carpets or big occasions. For me, saree was casual wear, my holiday wear\u201d. It is this love that has graduated into her association with a brand like Suta. \u201cThey want to make sure that modern women start embracing saree as their casual wear, and it doesn\u2019t become that extra hectic piece of clothing that they save only for specific occasions. So first, I incorporated that in my life, I totally loved it. I validated it, and then I wanted to take a step ahead because I saw so much love coming my way with these sarees. When I wear and I put up a picture or when I dress up in a saree that I want to make sure I share this experience with everyone through this collection,\u201d she concluded. A post shared by Taapsee Pannu (@taapsee) When it comes to work, Taapsee has back to back projects ready for release. She will be seen returning as Rani in the second part, Phir Aayi Hasseen Dillruba, which is scheduled to release on August 9 on Netflix.
